							<h1>Salem Weldegebriel</h1>
							<p>I am currently a junior at Gustavus Adolphus College, majoring in computer science with a minor in philosophy. I came to the United States as an international student. I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. My passion for problem-solving and building things led me to choose computer science as my field of study. I consider computer science more than a major; it is rather a way of life where I am constantly learning. It is my belief that with knowledge and a better understanding of things comes responsibility, that in the face of problems encountered, instead of giving in to complacency, there occurs a shift towards asking what could be done to contribute towards solving problems by utilizing tools learned while also continuing to expand the paradigm of better and better solutions. Such is the possibility of creation and innovation that falls in sight with the practice of technology. That process for me is a life of impact creation, and that way of life is the very way by which I envision myself living to make an impact towards society. So here I am on a journey, striving to become part of creators, thinkers, and innovators molding  the future of technology for the better. <br>Scroll down to leanr more about my experiences. </p>
